## Ask Me Why?

### Q: Why sort imports?

A: To help us review changes for pull/merge requests easier, sorting imports can help us a much. 
The codebase becomes more professional and more consistent, reviewers will be happier, and the review process will be faster, 
focusing on the implementation changes ONLY.

### Q: Vertical Ruler 80?
```
"editor.rulers": [80]
```
A: The practice of keeping code to 80 (or 79) columns was originally created to support people editing code on 80-column dumb terminals or on 80-column printouts.
Those requirement have mostly gone away now, but there are still valid reasons to keep the 80 column rule:

*To avoid wrapping when copying code into email, web pages, and books.
*To view multiple source windows side-by-side or using a side-by-side diff viewer.
*To improve readability. Narrow code can be read quickly without having to scan your eyes from side to side.
